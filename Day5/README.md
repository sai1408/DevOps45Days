#### Summary
In this tutorial, Abhishek provides a comprehensive guide on connecting to AWS EC2 instances through both the UI and Terminal, emphasizing the efficiency of automating virtual machine creation. He covers options such as AWS API, AWS CDK, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation templates, and Terraform. The tutorial focuses on logging into EC2 instances, showcasing UI-based connection and highlighting the limitations. Abhishek then introduces terminal options for Mac (iTerm), Windows (PuTTY, MobileXterm, NoMachine), and demonstrates connecting via SSH in the terminal. The guide concludes with practical insights into stopping and terminating instances and a preview of the upcoming exploration of AWS CLI for EC2 instance creation.
