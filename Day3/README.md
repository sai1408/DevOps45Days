#### Summary  
In this DevOps course session, Abhishek covers the crucial topic of virtual machines. He emphasizes the inefficiency of allocating entire physical servers to individual teams and introduces the concept of virtualization to address this problem.  
#### Highlights-  
💡 Abhishek explores the inefficiency of using entire physical servers for individual teams, leading to underutilization of resources.  
- 💻 Introduces the concept of virtualization as a solution to improve efficiency in resource utilization.  
- 🌐 Illustrates the analogy of a landowner realizing they don't need the entire land they own, prompting them to efficiently use and rent out the unused portion.  
- 🚀 Emphasizes that DevOps is about improving efficiency and efficiency is achieved through automation, such as using a hypervisor for virtualization.
- 🔄 Describes how a hypervisor allows logical separation of a physical server into multiple virtual machines, each with its own CPU, memory, and hardware.  
- ☁️ Connects the concept to cloud platforms like Amazon, explaining how they implement virtualization for efficient resource allocation
