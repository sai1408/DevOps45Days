## branches

main/master branch -- production code 

feature branch  - For every feature ( once satisfied and tested branch is deleted )
release branch  [p1,p2,p3 -- master is kept for active development] ( code will be built from release branch so that active development from main is not distrubed)  
hot fix branch is for short life like 1 or 2 days and then you will deliver it to both master and release branch{esp if there are any prod bugs}

- [08:46](https://youtu.be/MCyvYT8FS5w?t=526s) 🚀 Feature branches are created for introducing new features or making significant changes to an application. Developers collaborate on these branches, and changes are merged back to the main branch when confident.
- [10:56](https://youtu.be/MCyvYT8FS5w?t=656s) 🌐 Release branches are used to prepare and test code for delivery to customers. Building applications from release branches ensures stability for deployment, keeping the main branch free for active development.
- [14:11](https://youtu.be/MCyvYT8FS5w?t=851s) 🔥 Hotfix branches are created for urgent fixes in production. Changes made in hotfix branches should be merged both into the main branch and release branches to keep all codebases synchronized.

- [08:29](https://youtu.be/MCyvYT8FS5w?t=509s) 🌐 Feature branches are created for developing new features or making significant changes, ensuring they don't disrupt the main development branch until ready.
- [11:37](https://youtu.be/MCyvYT8FS5w?t=697s) 🚀 Release branches are used to build and deliver applications to customers, isolating them from ongoing development on the main branch.
- [14:11](https://youtu.be/MCyvYT8FS5w?t=851s) 🩹 Hotfix branches are created for urgent bug fixes in production, allowing quick resolution while maintaining the integrity of the main and release branches.
- [16:32](https://youtu.be/MCyvYT8FS5w?t=992s) 🔄 All changes made in feature, release, or hotfix branches should be merged back into the main branch to keep it up to date.
